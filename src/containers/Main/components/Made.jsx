                  D3LAB is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that studies
                  decentralized things in a decentralized manner. It was
                  established to point out that many blockchain projects contain
                  the so-called ‘inevitably’ centralized features for
                  profit-seeking and their convenience.

                  We believe that Cosmos and Cosmwasm will play an important
                  role in the near multi-chain future. And Rust, the core
                  language on both the core and contract, will be essential
                  knowledge to astronauts. However, there are not enough
                  educational materials to study them, and there is no space to
                  learn as an integrated flow. That makes many learners
                  discouraged. So we make Cosmonaut to educate astronauts as
                  pioneers.
