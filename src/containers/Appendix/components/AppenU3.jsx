        Keplr allows users to manage their own private keys by themselves
        without having to entrust the others such as a website. So that they can
        use them safely (if they believe in Keplr's security) regardless of the
        security of the website. The private key is stored on your local
        computer and is used to be signed offline.
      </BasicP>
      <Alert>
        The fact that Keplr has secured the security of the private key is only
        within the scope of the use of the key. This prevents applications from
        seizing private keys, but does not prevent malicious behavior in
        logic-level, such as calling approve on suspicious contracts.
