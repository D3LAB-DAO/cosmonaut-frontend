        To provide the intuitive service and a great user interface, developers
        must consider the following at the browser level:
      </BasicP>
      <ListStyle>
        <li>Assist users in creating Cosmos SDK transactions.</li>
        <li>Assist in signing unsigned transactions in your wallet.</li>
        <li>
          Assist Cosmos SDK endpoints to register and publish signed messages.
        </li>
        <li>Assist in placing multiple messages in a single transaction.</li>
      </ListStyle>
      <BasicP>
        In addition, in order for service and blockchain can take facilitative
        communication, you should consider the following:
      </BasicP>
      <ListStyle>
        <li>
          Assist with queries using legacy REST endpoints or gRPC endpoints to
          query Cosmos
        </li>
      </ListStyle>
      <BasicP>
        <CodeBlock>CosmJS</CodeBlock> can address these requirements.{" "}
        <CodeBlock>CosmJS</CodeBlock>' modular architecture makes it convenient
        for developers to integrate only the elements they need into the
        service, allowing them to optimize in many ways.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>
        Also, it is easy to integrate famous JavaScript frameworks such as Vue,
        React, and Express with <CodeBlock>CosmJs</CodeBlock>.
