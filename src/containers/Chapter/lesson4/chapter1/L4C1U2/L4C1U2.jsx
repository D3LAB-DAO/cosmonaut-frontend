                You can create a simple random number generator through
                timestamp of block.

              <BasicP>
                <CodeBlock>_generate_random_number</CodeBlock> has a timestamp
                in nanoseconds, take a modular operation with a specific value,
                and returns the result. In other words, it returns the remainder
                divided by a specific value{" "}
                <CodeBlock>MAX_FREIGHT_WEIGHT</CodeBlock>.
              </BasicP>
              <BasicP>
                <CodeBlock>MAX_FREIGHT_WEIGHT</CodeBlock> is defined by (1000 *
                1000), so
                <CodeBlock>_generate_random_number</CodeBlock> is a function
                that returns a random value between 0 and (1000 * 1000 - 1).
              </BasicP>
              <Alert>
                This random number generator can be very vulnerable. Because the
                information of time is objective but also subjective within a
                narrow range.
                <br />
                <br />
                Based on the current time, we can approximately infer that
                <CodeBlock>_generate_random_number</CodeBlock> will respond to a
                certain range.
                <br />
                <br />
                Crucially, the block producer who makes the block can freely
                manipulate the timestamp within a narrow range so that the
                desired random value comes out.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the blockchain, the block producer often has strong authority
                so you have to be very careful about making random values with
                the information within the blockchain.
