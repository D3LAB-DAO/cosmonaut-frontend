                We've come a long way. It's really time to make a game! In this

                passes through the asteroid belt.

                We've come a long way. It's really time to make a game! In this
                Flight Game, our lovely spaceship ESFERA passes through the

              </BasicP>
              <BasicP>
                The chances of passing through the asteroid belt depend on how
                many types and weights you have loaded.
              </BasicP>
              <ListStyle>
                <li>
                  Of course, if you load a lot of heavy freight, it will be
                  difficult for the spaceship to change direction and
                  accelerate, so it will be difficult to avoid asteroids.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conversely, lightweight spaceship have a slightly higher
                  probability of avoiding asteroids.
                </li>
              </ListStyle>
              <BasicP>
                Also, fuel is continuously used because the spaceship keeps
                moving.
              </BasicP>
              <ListStyle>
                <li>
                  Each round consumes 100 <CodeBlock>fuel</CodeBlock>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you run out of <CodeBlock>fuel</CodeBlock> before/after you
                  finish all the rounds, you're drifting.
