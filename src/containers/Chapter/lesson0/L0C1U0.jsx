        While Web Assembly allows programs written in several existing and new
        languages, <CodeBlock>Cosmwasm</CodeBlock> smart contract is
        almost written in <CodeBlock>Rust</CodeBlock> to enhance security.
        Thanks to an intelligent and industrious compiler,
        <CodeBlock>Rust</CodeBlock> can prevent explicit and implicit issues both at
        a compile time.

        programs.
