        You also need an environment in which the contract run. You can build a
        local network to deploy and test the contracts youâ€™ve created, but you
        can also use a network that already exists publically.

        Currently, The Cliffnet testnet is running actively. You can find out
        whether it's working well or not from the following URL.

        You can use wasmd or Node REPL to communicate with this network.

        If the wallet registration for the test was successfully done, wasmd
        will print out the information. Although it is a testnet, keep the
        mnemonic separately in a safe place in case of losing your password to
        prevent any small problems.

        As you know, all activities on the blockchain cost a fee. So you'll need
        some tokens for interaction.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>There are two native tokens in here.</BasicP>

        <ListStyle>
          <li>ROCK (urock) : Used to be a validator.</li>
          <li>PEBBLE (upebble) : Used to pay fees.</li>

        We want a fee to publish transaction, so we need to ask for an upebble.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>
        The following command requests some tokens from the faucet. Note that
        denom is upebble.
