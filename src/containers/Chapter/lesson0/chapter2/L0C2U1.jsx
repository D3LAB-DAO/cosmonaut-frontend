        wasmd, the core of Cosmwasm platform, is the Cosmos Zone implementation
        which supports smart contract.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>
        It is an addition of x/wasm based on cosmos/gaia.
        That is, the wasmd binaries behave like gaiad, with the x/wasm moduleâ€™s
        functionality. If someone is going to develop a smart contract, he
        should use a wasmd.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>
        To install wasmd, Go must be installed and PATH must be set well.
      </BasicP>
      <BasicP>Type the following command.</BasicP>
